# Spotify Song Popularity Predictor

This project implements a machine learning model to predict song popularity scores on Spotify using features like track name, artist name, and various audio metrics. The model uses TF-IDF vectorization for text data and standard scaling for numerical features to predict discrete popularity scores (ranging from 4-7).
